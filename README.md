# Duplicate Character Remover : Assignment

# This is a ReactJS app that allows users to remove duplicate characters from a string.
- It has two screens:
- Screen 1: A form where users can input a string and submit it to the app.
- Screen 2: A view where the app displays the original string, the current string, and a list of cards representing each character in the current. Users can click on the  delete icon on each card to remove all duplicate instances of that character in the string except the one that is being clicked.
- Note: Link to view the app: https://duplicate-char-remover.web.app/ . I have deployed it on firebase, more about it later in the readme.
